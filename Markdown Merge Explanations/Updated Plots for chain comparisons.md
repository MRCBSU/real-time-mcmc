## How to use the new run interface

1) Checkout the files *\<real-time-mcmc\>/R/output/chain_comparison.R* and *\<real-time-mcmc\>/R/output/tracePlots.R* from the branch SMED_Test_JK_Branch
2) Rerun the usual postprocessing and then run the chain comparison

This should then create the traceplots which show the prior density and the histograms of likelihood + random walk + prior density.
