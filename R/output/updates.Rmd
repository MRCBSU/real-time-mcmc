### Updates

#### Model and report changes

1. Over January 2022 our model was redesigned to incorporate the booster vaccination campaign and to be able to capture, in an unbiased way, the ecological effects of the emergence and subsequent dominance of the omicron variant. In particular, we have stratified the entire model by vaccination status so that we can more accurately capture the impacts of waning immunity. The duration of immunity following infection is assumed to have a mean of around 18 months, but this falls rapidly around the time of the emergence of Omicron to account for the immune escape of this variant. The waning of vaccine-derived immunity is captured through an assumed drop in vaccine efficacy at this time. 
1. A further modification to the model has been required due to the scaling back of the testing programme. Since March 2020 we have been calibrating the model against reported deaths within sixty days of a positive test. We now report the results from a model that uses data on new diagnoses in hospitals (where testing is still routine). The structure of the model remains similar but we make new assumptions about the proportion of infections that are detected by hospital-based testing, and the time taken post-infection for this detection to occur.
1. We have extended the use of serological data to use samples taken beyond the first wave of the pandemic. The samples are those collected by NHS Blood and Transplant using the Roche-N assay, which measures the prevalence of infection-acquired antibodies in the population. 
1. The model also accounts for a different susceptibility to infection in each adult age group (no prior information is used); and for the under-15s, (using prior information from [Viner et al, 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2771181), which estimates children to be less likely to acquire infection when in contact with an infectious individual). 
1. The model has the ability to incorporate estimates of community prevalence, by region and age group, from the Office of National Statistics Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (ONS CIS; see Data Sources for details). These are included weekly since the outset of the Survey in May 2020 for the age groups >4 years to provide a more timely source of information on recent trends in incidence.
1. The underlying probability of an unvaccinated individual testing positive in hospital following infection with SARS-CoV2 (the apparent infection-hospitalisation rate, IHR) is allowed to change gradually over the course of 30 days every (approximately) 100 days. This is designed to reflect fluctuations due to seasonal effects, demand on healthcare services or the emergence of new virus variants of differing severity.
1. The ‘Epidemic summary’ only reports the current value for the IHR by age. To visualise how this has changed over time in our model, see the IHR tab in the ‘Infections and Deaths’ section of the report. The quantity that is now plotted under this tab is the probability of being diagnosed in hospital if infected, taking into account the impact of the immunisation programme - it is an average of a lower rate of hospitalisation among vaccinated individuals and a higher rate among the unvaccinated.
1. The attack rate table shows the proportion of individuals to have ever been infected over the course of the pandemic. Under any `Infections’ tab, what is presented is the totality of all infections, including reinfections, and will therefore show values higher than the attack rate might suggest.



#### Updated findings

1. The estimated number of new daily infections on 9th July across England has not changed significantly from last week and is now 295,000 (259,000--335,000, 95% credible interval) infections per day, corresponding to a national daily infection rate  of 528 per 100k population. The highest rate is currently in the North West (NW) with 674 infections per 100K population, slightly ahead of Yorkshire and The Humber (YH) with 664. The next highest rates are to be found in the West Midlands (WM), South East (SE) and South West (SW) with 591, 534 and 512 infections per 100K population respectively, all above the national average. Greater London (GL) and East of England (EE) have infection rates of over 400 per 100k, whilst the lowest rates are estimated to be in the East Midlands (EM) and the North East (NE), though even here the rates are above 350 infections per 100k. Note that a substantial proportion of these infections will be asymptomatic.
1. The model predictions for the daily number of new diagnoses in hospitals reached a low of 350 per day around May 28th and has increased sharply since, though its  growth is estimated to be slowing, currently doubling in number every 29.3 days across the country. We forecast that by July 30th, there will be 1,800 to 2,400 new diagnoses in hospitals per day, having hit a peak around July 19th, a shift of two days from last week’s estimate.
1. The infection growth rate for England is 0.01 (0.01-- 0.02) per day. This means that, nationally, the number of infections is increasing, corresponding to an Rt of around 1.13. 
1. Though the national Rt is likely to be greater than 1, we estimate the epidemic to be at, or close to, a peak. The reproduction number is currently highest in the SE and YH.
1. Our estimates for the attack rate, the proportion of a population who have ever been infected, is up to 86.4% nationwide, and is over 90% in two regions, NE and WM. However, the estimated total number of infections to date (69.3m) far exceeds the size of the population of England, due to the presence of reinfections.
1. Note that the hospitalised diagnosis data used are only partially informative on Rt over the last two weeks. Therefore, the estimate for current incidence, Rt and the forecast of daily numbers of deaths are likely to be subject to significant revision.


#### Interpretation

Across England, we estimate that the daily number of diagnoses in hospitals remains on the increase. PCR-positive infection prevalence is estimated to be similarly increasing in all ONS regions except the NE and in all age groups. Despite the high rates of infection over the Omicron waves, continued waning of immunity and the increasing presence of the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-strains are sustaining a national Rt that is currently around 1.1.

Overall, since December 1st 2021, the Omicron variant has resulted in the cumulative number of infections increasing from 25.8 million individuals to 69.3 million. In total, 30% of all infections over the course of the entire pandemic are re-infections and this fraction is only expected to increase.

During the Omicron-era, December 2021-May 2022, we estimate a fall of over 75% in the IHR in the age groups over 45 and a decline of over 50% in the under 45 age groups. Since May, we estimate an increase to a pre-Omicron level in the under-45s, with small increases in the 45-64 and 65-74 age groups, whilst for the over-75s there is still evidence of an improving IHR. This phenomenon in the under-45s could, in part, be explained by a reduced protection from the vaccines against severe symptoms due to infection with BA.4 and BA.5. Additionally, the model does not yet include the second booster vaccinations that the over-75 age group have received, so any consequent improvement in health outcomes will be attributed to a drop in IHR. The overall IHR increases only modestly over this most recent, from 0.7% to 0.9%. The over-75s still have the highest IHR at 3.1% (2.9%--3.4%).
