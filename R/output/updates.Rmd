### Updates

#### Model and report changes

1. The model now accounts for the ongoing immunisation programme, stratifying the population of people still susceptible to infection with the virus according to their immunisation status (unimmunised/1 dose/2 doses). We use data on the daily proportions of the population getting immunised to inform this splitting of the population, assuming that it takes three weeks for vaccine-derived immunity to develop. Vaccine efficacy is assumed against both infection and death, using values for the efficacy in agreement with those found [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995101/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_24_v2.pdf). We have a changepoint in the vaccine efficacy on the 10th May, which marks a transition from alpha being the dominant variant, to delta.
1. The model also accounts for a different susceptibility to infection in each adult age group (no prior information is used); and for the under-15s, (using prior information from [Viner et al, 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2771181), which estimates children to be less likely to acquire infection when in contact with an infectious individual).
1. The model has the ability to incorporate estimates of community prevalence, by region and age group, from the Office of National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey (see Data Sources for details). These are included weekly since the outset of the Survey in May 2020 for the age groups >4 years to inform trends in incidence that are too recent to be captured by the data on deaths.
1. The geographical definition has been changed from the seven NHS regions ([map](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4dd34a2d07b43088e17ed73e1bd3357/data)) to the nine regions typically used in government ([map](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/738566d958834b70a809dc72a154eaf9/data)). This new spatial definition more appropriately reflects the existing regional heterogeneity.
1. The underlying probability of an unvaccinated individual dying following infection with SARS-CoV2 (the infection-fatality rate, IFR) is allowed to change gradually over the course of 30 days every (approximately) 100 days. This is designed to reflect fluctuations due to seasonal effects, demand on healthcare services or the emergence of new virus variants of differing severity.
1. The ‘Epidemic summary’ only reports the current value for the IFR by age. To visualise how this has changed over time in our model, see the IFR tab in the ‘Infections and Deaths’ section of the report. The quantity that is now plotted under this tab is the probability of _dying if infected_, taking into account the impact of the immunisation programme.

#### Updated findings

1. The estimate of the daily number of new infections on the 10th September across England is 40,900 (33,900--49,400, 95% credible interval). The daily infection rate is estimated to be 73 per 100K population per day nationally. The highest rate is in the North East (NE) with 172 infections per 100K population, corresponding to 4,580 daily infections. The next highest rates are in the East Midlands (EM), the South West (SW) and the West Midlands (WM) with 110, 103 and 102 infections per 100K (5,270, 5,790 and 6,000 new daily infections, respectively). Yorkshire and Humberside (YH) is next with 74 per 100K, the South East (SE) is at 62 and the East of England (EE),  London (GL) and North West (NW) have the lowest daily infection rates between 46 and 18 per 100k. Note that a substantial proportion of these infections will be asymptomatic.
1. The number of deaths occurring daily has continued to increase but it is predicted to start flattening such that we forecast between 67 and 129 deaths on the 1st of October.
1. The probability of Rt exceeding 1 has increased in most regions. It is now highest at 95% in the NE followed by the SE, SW, WM and EM all at around 85%; it is 46% in the YH and lower in the remaining regions, being particularly low in the NW (1%).
1. The growth rate for England is estimated at 0.01 (0.01-- 0.02) per day. This means that, nationally, the number of infections remains flat. This pattern continues to be the  result of heterogeneity in transmission in the different regions with increasing incidence in the NE, EM, SE, WM and SW and flat or decreasing in the others.  
1. This week we estimate GL to be the region with the highest attack rate, that is the proportion of the regional populations who have ever been infected, at 53% followed by NE  and the WM with 41% and 37% respectively. The SW continues to have the lowest attack rate at 25%. These attack rates are broadly consistent with our previous published report with the exception of London, where the attack rate has been revised upwards due to an estimated larger first wave of infection.
1. Note that the deaths data used are only very weakly informative on Rt over the last two weeks. Therefore, the estimate for current incidence, Rt and the forecast of daily numbers of deaths are likely to be subject to some revision.

#### Interpretation

The plots of the estimated Rt over the last week show a step increase in Rt, lifting it just above 1.0 in most regions. This increase is due to the greater social mobility following the summer school holiday period as children return to school and parents return to the workplace. The incidence of deaths has been gradually increasing since mid-June, although the actual numbers remain low in comparison to the peaks of the first two waves of infection. Similar to our most recent publication, our projections for the number of deaths suggest that we are now at, or are very close to, a peak.

Plots of the IFR over time show that from the end of January we estimate a decreasing IFR in all adult age groups, but most steeply in the older ages. This drop indicates the benefits of immunisation against death over and above the benefits against infection. Following this drop, over the last month there has been a slight increase to 3.5% (3.2%--3.8%) in the over-75s and 0.25% (0.23%--0.26%) overall.

For context, in addition to the data used here, the numbers of reported new positive tests (by date of specimen) have shown a slight decline. These numbers are, however, highly dependent on the targeting of testing, the public’s testing behaviour and might be subject to significant reporting delay, and therefore are difficult to interpret. Levels of hospital admission are now flat in almost all regions, while the prevalence of infection, as estimated by the ONS Coronavirus Infections Survey, has fallen slightly below 1.40% in England.
