### Updates

#### Model and report changes

1. The model now accounts for the ongoing immunisation programme, stratifying the population of people still susceptible to infection with the virus according to their immunisation status (unimmunised/1 dose/2 doses). We use data on the daily proportions of the population getting immunised to inform this splitting of the population, assuming that it takes three weeks for vaccine-derived immunity to develop. Vaccine efficacy is assumed against both infection and death, using values for the efficacy in agreement with those found [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995101/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_24_v2.pdf). We have a changepoint in the vaccine efficacy on the 10th May, which marks a transition from alpha being the dominant variant, to delta.
1. The model also accounts for a different susceptibility to infection in each adult age group (no prior information is used); and for the under-15s, (using prior information from [Viner et al, 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2771181), which estimates children to be less likely to acquire infection when in contact with an infectious individual).
1. The model has the ability to incorporate estimates of community prevalence, by region and age group, from the Office of National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey (see Data Sources for details). These are included weekly since the outset of the Survey in May 2020 for the age groups >4 years to inform trends in incidence that are too recent to be captured by the data on deaths.
1. The geographical definition has been changed from the seven NHS regions ([map](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4dd34a2d07b43088e17ed73e1bd3357/data)) to the nine regions typically used in government ([map](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/738566d958834b70a809dc72a154eaf9/data)). This new spatial definition more appropriately reflects the existing regional heterogeneity.
1. The underlying probability of an unvaccinated individual dying following infection with SARS-CoV2 (the infection-fatality rate, IFR) is allowed to change gradually over the course of 30 days every (approximately) 100 days. This is designed to reflect fluctuations due to seasonal effects, demand on healthcare services or the emergence of new virus variants of differing severity.
1. The ‘Epidemic summary’ only reports the current value for the IFR by age. To visualise how this has changed over time in our model, see the IFR tab in the ‘Infections and Deaths’ section of the report. The quantity that is now plotted under this tab is the probability of _dying if infected_, taking into account the impact of the immunisation programme.

#### Updated findings

1. The estimate of the daily number of new infections on the 4th September across England is 37,000 (30,100--45, 400, 95% credible interval). The daily infection rate is estimated to be 66 per 100K population per day nationally. The highest rate is in the South West (SW) with 116 infections per 100K corresponding to 6,470 new daily infections. The next highest rates of infection are in the North East (NE) with 102 infections per 100K (2,700 daily infections). The West Midlands (WM) has around 90 while East Midlands (EM) and East of England (EE) both have around 80 new infections per 100k each day. Yorkshire and Humberside (YH) is next with 66, while the South East (SE), London (GL) and North West (NW) have the lowest daily infection rates between 46 and 26 per 100k. Note that a substantial proportion of these infections will be asymptomatic.
1. The number of deaths occurring daily has continued to increase but it is predicted to start flattening such that we forecast between 63 and 121 deaths on the 25th of September.
1. The probability of Rt exceeding 1 has decreased in most regions. It is highest at 62% in the SW followed by values of around 50% in the EE and WM; it is around 30% or lower in the remaining regions, being particularly low in NW and GL (3% and 1% respectively).
1. The growth rate for England is estimated at 0.00 (-0.01-- 0.01) per day. This means that, nationally, the number of infections remains flat. This pattern is still the result of heterogeneity in transmission in the different regions: in the SW incidence is increasing; it has peaked in the NE and it is flat or decreasing in the others, with some potential for sustained transmission.
1. This week we estimate NE to be the region with the highest attack rate, that is the proportion of the regional populations who have ever been infected, at 39% followed by GL and the WM with 38% and 35% respectively. The SW continues to have the lowest attack rate at 23%. These attack rates are broadly consistent with our previous published report. 
1. Note that the deaths data used are only very weakly informative on Rt over the last two weeks. Therefore, the estimate for current incidence, Rt and the forecast of daily numbers of deaths are likely to be subject to some revision.

#### Interpretation

The plots of the estimated Rt over the most recent weeks continues to show Rt plateauing just below 1.0 in most regions. This plateau largely reflects low-levels of mobility and social interaction over the summer school holiday period, resulting in reduced rates of infectious contact. The incidence of deaths has been gradually increasing since mid-June, although the actual numbers remain low in comparison to the peaks of the first two waves of infection. Similar to our most recent publication, our projections for the number of deaths suggest that we are now close to the peak of the current summer wave.

Plots of the IFR over time show that from the end of January we estimate a decreasing IFR in all adult age groups, but most steeply in the older ages. This drop indicates the benefits of immunisation against death over and above the benefits against infection. Following this drop, over the last month there has been a slight increase to 3.3% (3.0%--3.6%) in the over-75s and 0.26% (0.24%--0.28%) overall.

For context, in addition to the data used here, the numbers of reported new positive tests have remained stable over the holiday period. This is, however, highly dependent on the targeting of testing and the public’s testing behaviour and, therefore, is difficult to interpret. Hospital admissions are showing a similar pattern nationally, with increases only evident in some regions. Prevalence of infection, as estimated by the ONS Coronavirus Infections Survey, remains high, staying constant at around 1.40% in England.
