### Updates

#### Model and report changes

1. The model now accounts for the ongoing immunisation programme, stratifying the population of people still susceptible to infection with the virus according to their immunisation status (unimmunised/1 dose/2 doses). We use data on the daily proportions of the population getting immunised to inform this splitting of the population, assuming that it takes three weeks for vaccine-derived immunity to develop. Vaccine efficacy is assumed against both infection and death, using values for the efficacy in agreement with those found [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995101/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_24_v2.pdf). We have a changepoint in the vaccine efficacy on the 10th May, which marks a transition from alpha being the dominant variant, to delta.
1. The model also accounts for a different susceptibility to infection in each adult age group (no prior information is used); and for the under-15s, (using prior information from [Viner et al, 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2771181), which estimates children to be less likely to acquire infection when in contact with an infectious individual).
1. The model has the ability to incorporate estimates of community prevalence, by region and age group, from the Office of National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey (see Data Sources for details). These are included weekly since the outset of the Survey in May 2020 for the age groups >4 years to inform trends in incidence that are too recent to be captured by the data on deaths.
1. The geographical definition has been changed from the seven NHS regions ([map](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4dd34a2d07b43088e17ed73e1bd3357/data)) to the nine regions typically used in government ([map](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/738566d958834b70a809dc72a154eaf9/data)). This new spatial definition more appropriately reflects the existing regional heterogeneity.
1. The underlying probability of an unvaccinated individual dying following infection with SARS-CoV2 (the infection-fatality rate, IFR) is allowed to change gradually over the course of 30 days every (approximately) 100 days. This is designed to reflect fluctuations due to seasonal effects, demand on healthcare services or the emergence of new virus variants of differing severity.
1. The ‘Epidemic summary’ only reports the current value for the IFR by age. To visualise how this has changed over time in our model, see the IFR tab in the ‘Infections and Deaths’ section of the report. The quantity that is now plotted under this tab is the probability of _dying if infected_, taking into account the impact of the immunisation programme - it is an average of a lower rate of death in vaccinated individuals and a higher rate among the unvaccinated.

#### Updated findings

1. The estimate of the daily number of new infections on the 17th September across England is 34,900 (28,600--43,400, 95% credible interval). The daily infection rate is estimated to be 62 per 100K population per day nationally. The highest rates are still the North East (NE) and the East of England (EE) with 87 and 76 infections per 100K population, corresponding to 2,310 and 4,720 daily infections respectively. These are now closely followed by the East Midlands (EM) and West Midlands (WM) with 75 and 70 infections per 100k. The South West (SW), South East (SE), Yorkshire and the Humber (YH) and London (GL) all have daily infection rates between 62 and 50 per 100k, with the lowest infection rate of 41 per 100k currently in the North West (NW). Note that a substantial proportion of these infections will be asymptomatic.
1. The number of deaths occurring daily has stabilised and is predicted to start falling, albeit slowly, such that we forecast between 62 and 122 deaths on the 15th of October.
1. In most regions, we now think it is less likely that Rt is bigger than 1. The probability of exceeding it is now highest at 63% and 62% in the EE and SE, followed by the SW and EM down around 26%; it is 24% and 22% in the WM and GL respectively.
1. The growth rate for England remains at 0.00 (-0.01--0.01) per day. This means that, nationally, the number of infections remains flat. This pattern continues to be the result of heterogeneity in transmission in the different regions with incidence increasing at a very slow rate in the EE and SE and flat or decreasing in the others.  
1. GL continues to be the region with the highest attack rate, that is the proportion of the regional populations who have ever been infected, at 54% followed by NE and the WM with 41% and 37% respectively. The SW continues to have the lowest attack rate at 25%. These attack rates are broadly consistent with our report published two weeks ago, with the estimate for the attack rate having briefly been revised downwards last week.
1. Note that the deaths data used are only very weakly informative on Rt over the last two weeks. Therefore, the estimate for current incidence, Rt and the forecast of daily numbers of deaths are likely to be subject to some revision.


#### Interpretation

The plots of the estimated Rt over the last weeks show a steady decrease in Rt, resulting in a value very close, but just below, 1.0 in England. The greater mobility induced by the return to school is currently showing no signs of increasing transmission to problematic levels. The incidence of deaths has been gradually increasing since mid-June, although the actual numbers remain low in comparison to the peaks of the first two waves of infection. Similar to our most recent publication, our projections for the number of deaths suggest that we may have reached a peak.

Plots of the IFR over time show that from the end of January we estimate a decreasing IFR in all adult age groups, but most steeply in the older ages. This drop indicates the benefits of immunisation against death over and above the benefits against infection. Following this drop, over the last month there has been a slight increase to 3.9% (3.6%--4.4%) in the over-75s and 0.25% (0.24%--0.27%) overall.  

For context, in addition to the data used here, the numbers of reported new positive tests (by date of specimen) were decreasing last week and are increasing this week, making the interpretation of any trend particularly challenging. These case numbers are, however, highly dependent on the volume and targeting of testing, the public’s testing behaviour and might be subject to significant reporting delay, and therefore are difficult to interpret. Levels of hospital admission continue to decline in some regions, while the prevalence of infection, as estimated by the ONS Coronavirus Infections Survey, has fallen further to 1.1% in England, the lowest it has been for some weeks.
